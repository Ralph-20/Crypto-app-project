This was a great project ! I got to make 2 different API calls, 1 for the currency 
converter and another for the newsfeed. Definitely going to lots of other projects 
with api calls to make something else in the future ! Also got hands on experience with 
react which was fun, I would love to become more familiar with it and really get good 
at styling apps. Overall, was a fun project and learned a lot, got to practice my skills 
and incorporate some API calls in a user-friendly interface.
